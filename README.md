# About Complianz Integrations

These .php files can be used by Complianz users to extend functionalities, either within Complianz itself, other services or plugins. Some integrations built upon premium features, and others can be used by all users. An example of a integration for premium users is creating variability in GEOIP, so you can choose regions or countries by code to serve existing consent management. 

We are open to new pull requests and integration requests if you found a new way to use Complianz for your specific needs.

## For Plugin Developers

We will include plugin specific integrations as well. We will keep adding new integrations on our own account, but recommend other plugin developers to do the same. For documentation, please [read this article](https://complianz.io/developers-guide-for-third-party-integrations/)

Some integrations will be integrated directly in Complianz.
